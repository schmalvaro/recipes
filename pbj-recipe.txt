2 tbsp peanut butter
2 tbsp jelly
2 slices bread

Place both slices of bread next to each other on a plate. Spread peanut butter
evenly on left slice of bread. Spread jelly evenly on right slice of bread. Turn
slice of bread with peanut butter over onto slice of bread with jelly so that
the peanut butter and jelly are in the middle of the sandwich. Eat.
